    "\n",
    "- **Generation**:  \n",

    "# üîë Why is Chunking Important for RAG?\n",
    "\n",
    "In **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**, the goal is to retrieve relevant documents (or document chunks) based on a query and use them to generate accurate responses.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Chunking plays a critical role because it directly impacts both **retrieval quality** and **generation effectiveness**.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### üìå Key Reasons\n",
    "- **Embedding Quality**  \n",
    "  Chunks must be semantically coherent to produce meaningful embeddings for retrieval.  \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Context Preservation**  \n",
    "  Chunks should retain enough context to be useful for both retrieval and generation.  \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Scalability**  \n",
    "  Efficient chunking reduces memory usage and processing requirements for large datasets.  \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Domain Relevance**  \n",
    "  For domain-specific use cases (e.g., customer support tickets), chunks should preserve critical information like product codes, timestamps, or issue descriptions.  \n",

    "# üß© Chunking Strategies in RAG\n",
    "\n",
    "Different **chunking strategies** can be applied depending on the dataset, task, and model constraints. Choosing the right one is critical for balancing **retrieval accuracy, context preservation, and efficiency**.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### üîπ 1. Fixed-size Chunking\n",
    "- Divides text into chunks of a fixed length (e.g., 100 words or 512 tokens).  \n",
    "- **Pros:** Simple, predictable, easy to implement.  \n",
    "- **Cons:** May cut off sentences or split related context unnaturally.  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### üîπ 2. Sentence-based Chunking\n",
    "- Splits text into chunks based on sentence boundaries.  \n",
    "- **Pros:** Preserves sentence integrity, avoids mid-sentence splits.  \n",
    "- **Cons:** May create chunks of uneven size, which can affect embedding consistency.  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### üîπ 3. Semantic Chunking\n",
    "- Groups text based on **semantic similarity or coherence** (e.g., clustering embeddings).  \n",
    "- **Pros:** Keeps related concepts together, improves retrieval relevance.  \n",
    "- **Cons:** More complex, requires additional computation.  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### üîπ 4. Overlapping Windows\n",
    "- Creates chunks with **overlapping segments** (e.g., 512 tokens with a 50-token overlap).  \n",
    "- **Pros:** Preserves context across boundaries, reduces risk of missing key info.  \n",
    "- **Cons:** Increases storage and indexing requirements.  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### üîπ 5. Document Structure-aware Chunking\n",
    "- Uses **document structure** (e.g., paragraphs, headings, sections) to create chunks.  \n",
    "- **Pros:** Naturally preserves logical flow and context.  \n",
    "- **Cons:** Not all documents have clean or consistent structure.  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### üîπ 6. Chunk Size Optimization\n",
    "- Dynamically adjusts chunk size based on **task requirements or evaluation metrics**.  \n",
    "- **Pros:** Adaptive, balances retrieval performance and efficiency.  \n",
    "- **Cons:** Requires experimentation and tuning.  \n"
